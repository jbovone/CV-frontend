            <p>I studied economics for 3 years, with excellent qualifications, but found out that I didn't liked that
                business, it was not for me at all.</p>
            <p> I was always interested in technology, and since I was a young boy, I fixed many PCs, from my family
                friends, but I wanted to become a professional, so I decided to study programming.</p>
            <p> I'm very curious, and I'm always learning new things and languages. And i have learned programming in a
                self-taught way, until I joined the r/a Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm in Mar del Plata city Argentina, but I'm open for relocation offers outside the city or
                plain abroad. Or remote.
